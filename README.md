# secmake

Tool to create `.sec` files from `.pdb`, `.dssp` or `.wolf` files.

A sec file describes the secondary structure (SS) elements of protein structures. These files are currently required by some of the [cath-tools](http://www.github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/cath-tools).

We are currently working on clearing the licensing for the code to be added as an open source. In the meantime, we have included some pre-compiled binaries for people to use.
